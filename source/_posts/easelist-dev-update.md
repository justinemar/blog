Last week i have posted that i am getting back into working with React with GraphQL and probably move to TypeScript afterwards. But for now, i have to make some choices on which CSS frameworks to use. In my past side projects i don't usually use CSS frameworks to build my UI i tend to style my UI from scratch with mobile-first responsive design, but since i want to focus more of my time on learning the ins and outs of using GraphQL and reduce overall development complexity i have decided to use a CSS framework for rapid prototyping.

After hours of deliberating with my conscience i made desicision to use [Bulma.io](https://bulma.io) a CSS framework by @jgthms -- It has no JS included which is great since i already have ReactJS to easily manipulate my UI. Choosing this framework was amazing! the documentations
is clean and easy to navigate, within several minutes i have a pleasant looking index page! The classes and helpers are easy to remember. There are no default styling so i was able to tweak it easily and the Sass variables can be modified with an ease. It also have great extensions such as image corousel's and dashboards.
